## Project Specs:
[Click to view rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

## Local Setup instructions:

- Fork that repo! From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- All members of the group should clone down the _forked_ repo.
- Once cloned, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page.  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.     
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.  This will update to the latest version of packages.  We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version.  If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.  

## Testing
There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).

## Technologies Used:
- ES6 Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Fetch API
- Mocha
- Chai

## Future Features & Goals:
- seperate pending and approved trips into their own containers
- Add the traveler agent interaction
